# Getting Started with PouchDB Fauxton Helper - Chrome Extension

This project was created to assist in the querying of pouchdb fauxton UI. The query box doesn't store previously used queries and hence we have to re-type the query if we want to execute it again. Hence, the idea was born to solve this problem. The extension adds a nice and handy UI to store executed queries and show them in a list, clicking on this list item would help you to execute again for the same query. 

## How to Use

As of now, this chrome extension is not yet submitted to chrome store, so you need to manually load it through developer mode -> load unpacked extensions.
